Simple, first you have to download the repository with:

```git clone https://github.com/StunxFS/SciterLib-Installer.git```

after downloading in the same terminal you write:

```sudo ./sciterlib-installer```

the operating system will it will ask for the password, enter it and wait for the installation of the library.
When it finishes this will send you the message:

```SUCCESS: Sciter shared library installed```

## Credits
The script was taken from the SciterSharp repository (https://github.com/ramon-mendes/SciterSharp), and modified because it had an old link from the c-smile Sciter repository to download the library.
